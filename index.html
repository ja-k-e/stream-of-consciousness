it’s hard for me to observe joy.
specifically the joy that i see people that look like me having.

it feels like a joy that i’m supposed to have.
but isn’t a joy that i feel like i want.

i look at families with parents that are my age.
with kids that i could have had.
deep in the world of family building.
protection.
security.

and it feels like something i’ve always wanted to have.
but never could.
not because i’m incapable.
not because i haven’t found the right situation.

it feels like it was never something for me.
it feels like something a different me could only experience.

that it’s not the life that i have been given
that something would have to change so deeply in me
for that to even be something that’s mine.

i look at families and i want to cry.
not because i feel like i missed out.
but because i feel like i’m on the outside. 

my understanding of the world
and people’s understanding of me
feel like a barrier to the joy.

there was a time.

when i thought that my life
would be having kids that play in the street
on an early summer day.
in a town
distant from everything else.

a life full
of family things
of bruises and scrapes.
of hurt feelings 
and water balloons thrown too hard.

that feels like an eternity away. 
a place that i don’t fit.

and it’s palpable
when i’m there as a guest.

everyone is enthusiastic about having me around
but i feel like i’m on the other side of a wall
and that people know it.
and that i don’t fit there.
and that makes me sad 
because i don’t know what joy looks like if it doesn’t look like that.

i feel like i’d like to experience the joy.
and that it would be disingenuous.

it would be something that i would be pretending to be.

i represent in so many ways
what others feel is missing from their life.
the alternative.
and there’s something exciting about that for them
and so they enjoy spending time with me.

and i sit on the other side.

not envious.

still sad.

i’m sitting here thinking about how friends leave.

you build relationships with people and you are a person for that time
and then time passes and you do different things
and you grow apart without realizing it.

because what’s happening in front of you is always most important.
most top of mind.

and then one day you miss being somewhere that you’re not
and you look around you 
and you see things that remind you of the way things used to be

you grow fond of the time where less time had passed.
where everything was more fresh and more real.

and you miss it.
and then you check in
with those friends.

and you realize how far you’ve grown apart.

and there’s still love
because there are still memories of the past.

but it’s not the same.
and there’s disappointment in that.

it reminds you of how much life you’ve lived.
which is ultimately a reminder of less life remaining
and that can be some thing that you don’t want to think about.

i am too tired
i a m too tire d
i yam  two tye red

i have nothing creative in me right now
i am trying
trying to be creative
and this this this right here is 
it iti t.
perhaps this is interesting
perhaps it is very much not
we will see 

i am just going to talk right now
i put my head back
and closed my eyes and cannot see what i am typing
i just looked down to see if i messed up.
i didnt. nice.
my eyes are closed again and i am kinda typing faster. 
whjp lows where the time goes.
i am so tired.
its like my capacity is ...
...
....
i dont know.

this whole time i wasnt looking
im back though because my fingers got misplaced.

i forgot about the small bumps on f an j keys. 
handy.
fingery?


i guess im here in the dark 
typing on my favorite website
hoping that this give me something back

there is a dim warm yellow light next to me. it is night.
the screen on my laptop is lit here too
maybe i shall turn the brightness down

ok i will.

hello friends. this is nice.

i worked with students today
and did some adult work too for my job
i am very lucky.

it is a thursday
but it feels like a no-day.
the kind of day where nothing is known
you just whiz through it

in full on response mode

no time to contemplate

except the drive back from englewood
reflecting on the time you spent building relationships
with kids who have so much more ahead of them
then you ever felt you had.
though you did indeed have it ahead of you.

the time i spend teaching
is time i spend thriving

im sure it wouldnt be easy if i did it full time
but it sure feels like a good fit.

that time is spent in bliss
nothing else matters
everything feels like the right expenditure of energy

not questioning decisions,
or weighing them tactically for the sake of a career move.
just being present.
with people.
who want someone to be present with them.
who want to make someone laugh
or learn from them
or someone to hug or giggle about.

someone to see them.

i like to see people.
i like them to know they got it.
that what they are doing is valid.
that they are valuable
even if they dont know what they want.
if they dont make anything.

student j made me a website tribute today in fifteen minutes
did it to make me laugh.
was proud to show me.
it was really funny.
j is the quiet one.
that i nudge and say hey
while they pretend to ignore me.
